# emotions_Orange (Classification and clustering)

To analyze emotions.tab, a data transformation process was first performed, replacing the variables amazedsurprised, happy-pleased, relaxing-calm, quiet-still, sad-lonely and angry-aggresive by letters. I have used 3 classification models:
1. Random Forest.
2. Decision Tree.
3. SVM.

The results obtained are the following:

- SVM is the best model 
- Decision Tree is the worst model.
